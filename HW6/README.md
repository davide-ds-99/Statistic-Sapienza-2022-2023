<h1>Distribution Mean & Variance</h1>
Take any population and any variable X  and draw m (large) samples of size n (as you like) and represent the following 2 distributions : <br>
<ul>
<li>Distribution of the Mean
<li>Distribution of the Variance.
</ul>
Finally, for each distribution compute mean and variance and compare with the corrisponding values in the population.
